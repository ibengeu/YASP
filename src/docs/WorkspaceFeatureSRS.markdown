# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Workspace Feature

## 1. Introduction

This SRS details the technical requirements for implementing the workspace feature in the API development and documentation platform. The workspace feature is a module that extends the platform’s capabilities to support collaborative API development, organization, and management. It interacts with existing components (e.g., `endpoint-detail.tsx`, `schema-table.tsx`) and introduces new backend and frontend functionality.

## 2. System Overview

The workspace feature enables teams to create collaborative environments for managing API projects, including OpenAPI specifications, endpoints, schemas, and documentation. It supports real-time collaboration, version control, task management, and integrations with external tools, leveraging the platform’s existing support for OpenAPI standards and Swagger UI.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Workspace Creation and Management

- **FR1**: The system shall allow users to create a workspace with a name (max 100 characters) and optional description (max 500 characters).
- **FR2**: The system shall support associating multiple OpenAPI spec files (YAML/JSON) with a workspace.
- **FR3**: The system shall allow users to create folders or tags within a workspace for resource categorization.
- **FR4**: The system shall provide a dashboard displaying recent activity (e.g., last 10 changes), pending tasks, and pinned resources.

### 3.2 Collaboration Tools

- **FR5**: The system shall support real-time editing of API specs and documentation using WebSocket-based synchronization.
- **FR6**: The system shall allow users to add comments (max 1000 characters) on endpoints, schemas, or spec sections.
- **FR7**: The system shall implement role-based access control with three roles: Admin (full access), Editor (edit/view), Viewer (view only).
- **FR8**: The system shall send notifications for updates (e.g., new comments, spec changes) via in-app alerts and optional email.

### 3.3 Version Control

- **FR9**: The system shall store a version history for each spec, including version number, timestamp, and author.
- **FR10**: The system shall allow users to compare two spec versions, highlighting differences in endpoints, schemas, or parameters.
- **FR11**: The system shall support reverting to a previous spec version or branching a spec for experimental changes.
- **FR12**: The system shall optionally integrate with Git repositories via OAuth for external version control.

### 3.4 Interactive API Testing

- **FR13**: The system shall embed Swagger UI for rendering and testing OpenAPI specs within the workspace.
- **FR14**: The system shall allow users to save test configurations (e.g., headers, query params) as JSON objects linked to the workspace.
- **FR15**: The system shall support mock servers using libraries like `prism` to simulate API responses.

### 3.5 Task Management

- **FR16**: The system shall allow users to create tasks with a title (max 200 characters), description (max 1000 characters), assignee, status, and optional due date.
- **FR17**: The system shall link tasks to specific endpoints or schemas via unique IDs.
- **FR18**: The system shall display task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done) on the workspace dashboard.

### 3.6 Import/Export and Integrations

- **FR19**: The system shall support importing OpenAPI specs (YAML/JSON) via file upload or URL.
- **FR20**: The system shall allow exporting specs as YAML or JSON files.
- **FR21**: The system shall provide webhooks for integrating with external tools (e.g., GitHub, Postman).

### 3.7 Personalization

- **FR22**: The system shall allow users to pin up to 10 resources (e.g., endpoints, specs) to the workspace dashboard.
- **FR23**: The system shall support workspace themes (e.g., light/dark mode) and layout customization (e.g., grid/list view).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

- **NFR1**: The workspace dashboard shall load in &lt;2 seconds for workspaces with 10 specs and 50 endpoints.
- **NFR2**: Real-time editing shall synchronize changes across users in &lt;500ms under normal network conditions.
- **NFR3**: The system shall handle 100 concurrent users per workspace with &lt;5% error rate.

### 4.2 Security

- **NFR4**: The system shall encrypt workspace data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).
- **NFR5**: The system shall enforce role-based access control for all workspace actions.
- **NFR6**: The system shall log all workspace actions (e.g., spec edits, user invites) for auditing.

### 4.3 Scalability

- **NFR7**: The system shall support up to 1000 workspaces per organization and 100 specs per workspace.
- **NFR8**: The database shall handle 10,000 concurrent read/write operations per second.

### 4.4 Compatibility

- **NFR9**: The system shall support OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications.
- **NFR10**: The system shall be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (latest two versions).

### 4.5 Reliability

- **NFR11**: The system shall achieve 99.9% uptime for workspace features.
- **NFR12**: The system shall implement error handling for failed spec imports or test executions
